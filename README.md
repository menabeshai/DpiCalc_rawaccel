This project was created due to a lack of resources existing.

Sensitivity calculators had discrepency also had increments of 1. most mouses only have increments of 20-50DPI. only 1 mouse via software did incredments of 1. $80 vs RawAccel.
These scripts calculate DPI to sensitivity mulitplier and adjust accordingly. If you have pyperclip(optional) it'll auto copy the final number to your clipboard so you can just paste it into RawAccel.

To keep it simple yet give insturctions to allow it to be Dummy Proof.

1. Mouse DPi.
2. Current RawAccel Multiplier.
3. Desired DPI. This number you get from your sensitivity calculators.

The number that appears when you hit enter is the number you put into the sensitivity multiplier in RawAccel

The GAME LIMIT file. some have DPI or sensitivity limits. this compensates for that and adjusts accordingly. they are optional. Hence enter to skip.

4-5. Game sensitivity upper/lower limit. (Vanquish is 1 example that has a limit)

6. Game DPI limit. (Vanquish is 1610 as an example)

The number that appears when you hit enter is the number you put into the sensitivity multiplier in RawAccel

The way i do it. I get as close as possible then do the script.

Example.

3000 is aimlabs

3239 is COD lowest discrepency. But my mouse can only do 3230. set it to that.

use script.

3230

your RawAccel multiplier.

3239

your new multiplier. you now have effectively 3239. MAKE SURE TO SET YOUR IN GAME SENSITIVITY. this doesn't exxlude that.


ENJOY the lowest discrepency possible. Now the only reason to Buy a mouse as performance wise is sensor accuracy. rather than the DPI it provides. (this is an oversimplification)
